//! Resource monitoring for benchmark execution
//!
//! This module provides real-time monitoring of CPU and memory usage during
//! document extraction, with percentile calculations for performance analysis.
//! When the "memory-profiling" feature is enabled, heap allocation snapshots
//! are captured alongside RSS and virtual-memory samples.
//!
//! # Measurement Methodology
//!
//! Both memory and CPU measurements include the entire process tree (parent + all
//! child processes). This is critical for accurate measurement of extraction
//! frameworks that spawn subprocesses (e.g., pandoc, tika). Without this,
//! measurements would only capture the idle wrapper process, not the actual
//! extraction work happening in child processes.
//!
//! Changed in v4.0: Previously only measured parent process memory.
//! Changed in v4.3.7: CPU now also measures the entire process tree (previously
//! only measured parent process CPU, causing near-zero readings for subprocess-based
//! frameworks).
