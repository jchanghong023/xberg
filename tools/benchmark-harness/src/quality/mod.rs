//! Quality scoring module for benchmark results.
//!
//! Computes F1-based quality metrics by comparing extracted text against ground truth.
//! Uses token-level (bag-of-words) precision and recall.
//!
//! # Scoring weights
//!
//! Text-only scoring uses a **0.6 / 0.4 text / numeric split**:
//!
//! ```text
//! quality_score = 0.6 * f1_text + 0.4 * f1_numeric
//! ```
//!
//! Numeric tokens receive disproportionate weight (40% despite typically being
//! a small fraction of the token count) because financial documents, scientific
//! papers, and tabular data depend heavily on number accuracy. A single wrong
//! digit can invalidate an entire table row or equation.
//!
//! When markdown ground truth is available, **combined scoring** kicks in:
//!
//! ```text
//! quality_score = 0.5 * f1_text + 0.2 * f1_numeric + 0.3 * f1_layout
//! ```
//!
//! The layout component (`f1_layout`) is canonical SF1 from
//! [`structural_sidecar`] and captures structural fidelity across paragraph,
//! heading, list, table, binding-edge, and reading-order dimensions.
//!
//! # Tokenization
//!
//! Tokenization is intentionally simple: NFKC-normalize, lowercase, split on whitespace
//! (with `|` also treated as a separator so markdown table cell padding cannot change the
//! token stream), strip non-alphanumeric characters except periods and commas embedded
//! between alphanumeric characters (preserving decimal numbers like "3.14" and European
//! format "3,14"). CJK runs use character bigrams because Chinese, Japanese, and Korean OCR
//! engines commonly insert layout-dependent line breaks mid-word; bigrams never cross a
//! whitespace/line boundary, so reordered lines are still detected as errors. This preserves
//! punctuation that is semantically meaningful while ignoring decorative punctuation.
//!
//! # Reading order (report-only)
//!
//! `f1_score_text` is a bag-of-tokens (multiset) F1: it is order-insensitive by
//! construction, so it cannot detect reading-order failure (a fully scrambled document can
//! still score near-perfect F1 as long as every token survives somewhere). This matters
//! because vertical-Japanese OCR fails precisely by scrambling reading order.
//! [`reading_order_score`] measures order fidelity separately via anchor-based LIS. It is
//! computed and reported on [`QualityMetrics`] but is **intentionally not folded into
//! `quality_score`** pending corpus-wide distribution analysis — see that function's docs.
