//! KNOWN DEFECT, not a passing feature: pins a general-purpose bug found
//! while investigating GH#1770 but deliberately NOT fixed there (out of
//! scope — a much larger blast radius than the narrow fixed-pitch gate).
//!
//! `extractors/text/operators.rs`'s `Operator::Tm` "batch character-by-
//! character Tm+Tj patterns" buffer-continuation optimization glues two
//! same-baseline, same-transform glyph runs together with NO horizontal gap
//! check at all — see the match guard at `operators.rs:69-86`: it tests
//! baseline proximity (`f`), identical `a`/`b`/`c`/`d`, and forward
//! progression (`e >= start.e`), and nothing else. This holds for ANY font,
//! not just monospace, and for ANY gap size, not just a fixed-pitch cell.
//!
//! This test documents the defect on a PROPORTIONAL font (unlike GH#1770's
//! monospace repro) across several gap distances, including an extreme
//! 100pt gap that is obviously not intra-word kerning by any measure. It
//! asserts the CURRENT (buggy) glued output on purpose, so a future fix for
//! this general case turns it red — that is the intended trigger to update
//! or remove this test, not a regression in this test itself.
//!
//! GH#1778 investigation (no-ship): a fix routing this arm through the same
//! corpus-tuned geometric threshold `should_insert_space` uses for its
//! "strong geometric signal alone" rule (50% of the font's space-glyph
//! width) was implemented and found UNSAFE — it broke
//! `tests/table_cell_word_seam.rs`, whose fixture exists specifically to
//! prove no gap-magnitude constant can separate a real word space from an
//! intra-word fragment seam: a producer that draws one word as several
//! Tm+Tj fragments can position them with a seam (there: 1.75pt) WIDER than
//! a legitimate word space elsewhere on the same line (there: 1.53pt). Any
//! threshold that keeps such fragments fused also swallows real spaces, and
//! any threshold that keeps real spaces also splits such words — "Credit"
//! became "Cre d it". `should_insert_space`'s cross-span path avoids this
//! because it runs AFTER both texts are known and can lean on
//! following-text-dependent signals (source-order/glyph evidence via the
//! span-level merger); the Tm-continuation arm decides before the *next*
//! Tj's text is decoded (Tm arrives before its Tj), so it structurally
//! cannot consult those signals without a deferred-decision redesign of the
//! per-glyph append path — out of scope for a gap-check fix. Left open.
