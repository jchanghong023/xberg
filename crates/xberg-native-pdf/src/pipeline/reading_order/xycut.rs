//! XY-Cut recursive spatial partitioning for multi-column text layout.
//!
//! This module implements the XY-Cut algorithm per PDF Spec Section 9.4 for
//! recursive geometric analysis without semantic heuristics. Uses projection
//! profiles to detect column boundaries in complex layouts.
//!
//! Per ISO 32000-1:2008:
//! - Section 9.4: Text Objects and coordinates
//! - Section 14.7: Logical Structure (prefers structure tree when available)
//!
//! # Algorithm Overview
//!
//! 1. Compute horizontal projection (white space density across X)
//! 2. Find valleys (gaps) where density < threshold
//! 3. Split region at widest valley (vertical line)
//! 4. Recursively partition left and right sub-regions
//! 5. Alternate to vertical projection if no horizontal valleys found
//! 6. Base case: Sort spans top-to-bottom, left-to-right
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! Typical newspaper page: ~100 spans, < 5ms processing time
//! Recursive depth: O(log n) for balanced columns

// TODO(xberg-io/xberg#1567): 4 cyclomatic-complexity and 13 size/complexity findings
// in this file, currently excluded via the quality-debt baseline in alef.toml. Splitting
// these needs compiler-in-the-loop verification, not a mechanical pass. Delete this
// note and the file's baseline entry together once it goes green. Help wanted.

/// sub-threshold) density. The run's arithmetic midpoint has no relation
/// to where that content sits, so it can land squarely inside a figure
/// caption even though a genuinely empty gutter exists elsewhere in the
/// same run.
///
/// Tie-break order, applied to the contiguous sub-runs that attain the
/// run's minimum density value:
///   1. Widest sub-run wins — a genuine open gutter is wide; an isolated
///      single-bin dip that happens to share the same minimum density
///      is not a gutter and should not win over a real one.
///   2. On a width tie, the sub-run whose center is nearest the WHOLE
///      run's arithmetic midpoint wins — keeps the choice deterministic
///      and, when nothing else distinguishes the candidates, close to
///      the pre-fix behavior.
///
/// When the run is uniformly at its minimum density throughout (the
/// common case: a real, empty column gutter with no stray content), the
/// single minimal sub-run IS the whole run, so this returns exactly the
/// old midpoint — the fix only changes behavior in the buggy case where
/// sub-threshold content is unevenly distributed inside the run. That
/// exactness is why centers are computed in f32 as `(lo + hi) / 2`:
/// an integer `lo + width / 2` truncates, which would shift the split
/// by half a unit on every odd-width run. That arithmetic is pinned by
/// `a_candidate_that_would_cut_a_span_is_rejected`, whose chosen gap has
/// odd width -- NOT by `uniform_run_split_is_unchanged_from_the_legacy_midpoint`,
/// which cannot reach it: a uniform run's midpoint is by definition at the
/// floor, so the guard below returns before any centre is computed. ~keep
/// Share of the projected region a below-threshold run must exceed before its midpoint is
/// treated as untrustworthy (GH#1763).

/// A real column gutter is narrow -- 15 to 80 pt on a region of roughly 500 pt, so 3% to 16%
/// -- and its midpoint is the gutter, which is why splitting there worked for years. The
/// GH#1763 page is the opposite case: its "valley" is 254 pt of a 523 pt region, 48.6%,
/// because the left column is a figure and a 7.2 pt caption that fall below the density
/// threshold almost everywhere. A run that wide is not a gutter at all, it is a sparse
/// region, and its arithmetic midpoint says nothing about where the columns divide.
///
/// 35% sits well above any plausible gutter and well below the reporting page. Relocating
/// regardless of run width was measured across 230 corpus documents and was not an
/// improvement: 23 documents changed and, by absolute dictionary-valid word count, more got
