//! Per-document tally of recoverable input handling.
//!
//! Real PDFs routinely carry a missing embedded font, an object absent from the
//! xref table, or an unsupported CFF version. The parser handles all of these,
//! so none of them is a condition an operator can act on. Reporting each
//! occurrence at WARN made WARN unusable: measured over a 4,000-document corpus,
//! `xberg_native_pdf` emitted 4,012,488 WARN events against 44 real failures —
//! 99.96% of the run, roughly 863 events per document, one genuine failure per
//! 91,000 warnings (GH#1547).
//!
//! Two things are wrong there and both are fixed here. The *level* is wrong:
//! recoverable input handling is flow detail, so the per-occurrence events moved
//! to TRACE per this repo's level contract ("TRACE — per-item detail"). The
//! *cardinality* is wrong independently of level: one event per byte run or per
//! object is the wrong granularity for a corpus even at DEBUG. Each site now
//! increments a counter, and the document emits one DEBUG summary carrying the
//! totals when it is dropped. Someone debugging a single document still learns
//! what happened; someone running a corpus is not buried.
//!
//! ERROR behaviour is deliberately untouched — it already corresponded one to
//! one with documents that genuinely failed to parse.
