//! Regression test for internal issue #289 (GitHub xberg-io/xberg#1387).
//!
//! # The defect class
//!
//! `crates/xberg/src/core/mime.rs` holds `static FORMATS` — the ungated catalogue of every
//! document format the codebase knows how to *describe*. Every extractor that turns one of
//! those formats into text, by contrast, is `#[cfg(feature = "…")]`-gated in
//! `crates/xberg/src/extractors/mod.rs::register_default_extractors`. Nothing structurally ties
//! the two together, so a build whose Cargo feature set omits an extractor still advertises the
//! format and then rejects it with `XbergError::UnsupportedFormat`.
//!
//! That is exactly what shipped in 1.0.13/1.0.14: `crates/xberg-ffi/Cargo.toml`'s
//! `cfg(not(any(android, ios, windows, macos-x86_64)))` dependency — the block that builds the
//! native libraries for linux-x64, linux-aarch64 and macos-arm64 — lost its baked `"full"`
//! feature and was left with a hand-enumerated list that omitted `excel`, `hwp`, `hwpx`,
//! `iwork`, `wordperfect`, `mdx`, `xml` and `qr-codes`. Reporters saw `.xlsx` listed by
//! `list_supported_formats()` and rejected by `extract()` in the same process.
//!
//! # Why this test is gated on `full` rather than made feature-aware
//!
//! The constraint is that the catalogue and the registry must agree *in whatever build is
//! running*. Two shapes satisfy that:
//!
//! 1. Gate the whole test on `feature = "full"` and assert the complete catalogue resolves.
//! 2. Run in every build and skip a format when its gating Cargo feature is genuinely off.
//!
//! Shape 2 is rejected deliberately. It needs a hand-maintained map from each of the ~90
//! catalogue entries to the `cfg!(feature = "…")` that gates its extractor — a second,
//! independent copy of the same truth, kept in sync by hand. That copy can drift out of step
//! with `register_default_extractors`, and when it does the test would *skip* the format it was
//! supposed to guard, passing while the defect is live. Encoding the bug's own failure mode
//! (two hand-maintained lists silently diverging) into its regression test is not acceptable.
//!
//! Shape 1 has no such copy: under `full` every format extractor is compiled in by definition,
//! so any declared canonical MIME or alias that does not resolve to a registered extractor is a
//! catalogue lie — either a `FORMATS` entry added without an extractor, or an aggregate feature
//! that stopped implying one. The cost is that narrow builds are not covered here; those are
//! covered from the other side by `list_supported_formats()`'s registry intersection (issue
//! #308) and, for the FFI manifest specifically, by
//! `crates/xberg/tests/issue_1387_xlsx_ffi_feature_regression.rs`.
//!
//! # Relationship to the in-crate alias guard
//!
//! `core::mime`'s test module has `every_declared_alias_resolves_to_the_same_extractor_as_its_
//! canonical_mime`, which checks alias → canonical routing and deliberately *skips* any format
//! whose canonical MIME has no extractor. This test is the complementary half: canonical →
//! registered. Neither subsumes the other.
//!
//! The catalogue is read out of the `mime.rs` source because `FORMATS` is a private `static`
//! with no public enumeration API, and `list_supported_formats()` cannot stand in for it — that
//! function already filters itself by the very registry lookup under test, so asserting against
//! its output would be tautological.
//!
//! This test only reads the process-global extractor registry; it never registers, clears or
//! otherwise mutates it, so it is safe alongside tests that exercise registry lifecycle.
