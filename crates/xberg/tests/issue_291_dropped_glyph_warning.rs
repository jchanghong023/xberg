/// Build a minimal one-page PDF whose `/Resources /Font /F1` entry points at
/// object 5, which is a PDF string (`(NotAFontDict)`) rather than a font
/// dictionary. `xberg_native_pdf`'s `PageRenderer::load_resources`
/// (`page_renderer.rs`) resolves every `/Font` resource through
/// `PdfDocument::get_or_load_font_for_rendering`, which requires the
/// resolved object to be a dictionary; here it fails with `Error::ParseError
/// { reason: "Font object is not a dictionary" }`.
///
/// Per issue #1364, that failure does not abort the page: `load_resources` logs it via
/// `tracing::warn!("rendering text with fallback font data")` -- a sanitized static
/// message, with the actual diagnosis carried in structured tracing fields rather than
/// the message -- and continues, so every glyph the content stream later paints with
/// `/F1` is dropped (the renderer has no font to shape it with) while the page still
/// renders `Ok`. Unlike a
/// missing font *name* (which `xberg_native_pdf` best-effort substitutes via
/// `fontdb` system-font matching and may or may not warn about depending on
/// which fonts happen to be installed), a structurally invalid font
/// **resource** always fails to parse regardless of the host's installed
/// fonts, making this the deterministic repro for CI.
