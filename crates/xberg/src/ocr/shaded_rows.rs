//! Per-band (per table row) shading normalization for OCR preprocessing (GH#1785).
//!
//! Whole-page Otsu binarization uses one threshold for the entire page. A subtotal or
//! total row rendered as dark text on a light grey fill, or white text on a mid or dark
//! grey fill, does not survive that single threshold and the whole row is dropped. This
//! module finds each shaded horizontal band, works out its own polarity, and stretches
//! its contrast so the fill becomes white and the ink becomes black, leaving the rest of
//! the page untouched. It is a direct, constant-for-constant Rust port of the `flatten`
//! reference script attached to GH#1785 (`bands.py` + `preproc.py`), which the issue
//! measured against a synthetic and a scanned schedule page.
//!
//! This is deliberately **not** a replacement for whole-page binarization: GH#1785's own
//! measurement shows the per-band step regresses mid-fill rows on the clean page (12/12
//! values read by default, 6/12 after normalization), so it must stay an opt-in step
//! (`ImagePreprocessingConfig::normalize_shaded_rows`, default `false`), not a new
//! default behavior.
//!
//! GH#1837 traced that mid-fill regression, and a larger unreported dark-fill one, to two
//! places where this port follows the reference script onto a full page it was never run on:
//! `invert_dark_bands` padded onto the paper around a band, and `normalize_band` took its
//! statistics across the page width rather than the band's own fill. Both now stop at the
//! fill, but the default stays `false` until the opt-in path is re-measured against
//! `tests/fixtures/ocr/shaded_table_scan.pdf` -- the fix is not itself the measurement.
