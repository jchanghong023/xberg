/// pool name in a header band — and that caption belongs to no member, so the
/// enclosure owns it. What separates such a caption from a UML class box's own
/// name, or a BPMN task's, is what the enclosure holds: a class box draws
/// compartments and markers, which are interior detail nothing connects to,
/// while a cluster groups nodes that the diagram's own connectors land on.
/// So a labelled enclosure is a container only when the shapes it encloses are

/// clear of the enclosure's border by the snap tolerance separates the two —
/// a cluster's members are joined well inside it, while everything touching a
/// class box happens on its rim.
///
