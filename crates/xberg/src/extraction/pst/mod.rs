//! PST (Outlook Personal Folders) file extraction.
//!
//! This module handles extraction of emails from Microsoft Outlook PST files
//! using the `outlook-pst` crate.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - **Unicode and ANSI PST support**: Handles both modern and legacy PST formats
//! - **Folder hierarchy traversal**: Extracts messages from all folders recursively
//! - **Message properties**: Extracts subject, sender, recipients, body
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! Not run as a doctest: `pub(crate)`, so it is unreachable from a downstream crate.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use xberg::extraction::pst::extract_pst_messages;
//!
//! # fn example() -> xberg::Result<()> {
//! let pst_bytes = std::fs::read("archive.pst")?;
//! let (messages, _warnings) = extract_pst_messages(&pst_bytes)?;
//!
//! for msg in &messages {
//!     println!("Subject: {:?}", msg.subject);
//! }
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```

/// `MutexGuard` alive, and then calls `TableContextInner::read`, which tries
/// to lock the *same* `Mutex` again on the same thread. `std::sync::Mutex` is
/// not reentrant, so the second `.lock()` call blocks forever — this happens
/// before a single row is read, on every PST file, not only malformed ones.
/// Upstream fixed this on `main` (PR #55) by scoping the lock guard to a block
/// that ends before `TableContext::read` runs, but nothing has been published:
/// crates.io tops out at 1.2.0 and the `outlook-pst` release workflow has no
/// `release-pr` job, so no 1.2.1 appears without a maintainer manually
/// bumping the version.
///
/// Instead of calling `root_hierarchy_table()`, this function reaches the
/// identical node (`NodeId::new(HierarchyTable, NID_ROOT_FOLDER.index())`)
/// through a path that is *already* correctly scoped in 1.2.0:
/// `FolderInner::read_table` binds its B-tree node inside a block, so the
/// file-reader lock is dropped before `TableContext::read` is called. Opening
/// the root folder through the public API —
/// `store.properties().make_entry_id(NID_ROOT_FOLDER)` ->
/// `store.open_folder(&entry_id)` -> `folder.hierarchy_table()` — is exactly
/// how upstream's own `FolderInner::read` expects the root to be opened:
/// `NID_ROOT_FOLDER`'s type bits (`0x122 & 0x1F == 0x02`) satisfy the
/// `NormalFolder | SearchFolder` gate, and `read` even special-cases
/// `entry_id.node_id() == NID_ROOT_FOLDER` when computing the folder type.
///
/// `Folder::hierarchy_table()` returns `Option`, not `Result` (it swallows
/// the underlying read error via `.ok()` internally), so its `None` case is
/// reported below as its own `ProcessingWarning` distinct from the two error
/// arms above it — never silently treated as "no folders found".

/// [MS-PST] 2.4.8.6, are specified to reference messages that physically live
/// in another (non-search) folder — a real aliasing hazard for a naive
/// per-folder walk. This was investigated against the vendored `outlook-pst`
/// 1.2.0 source rather than assumed: `Folder::contents_table()`
/// (`FolderInner::contents_table` in `messaging/folder.rs`) is *not*
/// type-aware — for every folder, search or normal, it unconditionally reads
/// `NodeIdType::ContentsTable` (nid type `0x0E`). A search folder's actual
/// linked-message rows live under the distinct `NodeIdType::SearchContentsTable`
/// (nid type `0x10`, same node index, different type tag per `NodeId::new`'s
/// bit layout in `ndb/node_id.rs`) — a variant that exists only as an enum
/// case in `ndb/node_id.rs` and is never referenced anywhere else in the
/// crate. So `contents_table()` on a search folder looks up a node id that a
/// search folder never has, and returns `None` (`read_table` maps a missing
/// B-tree entry to `Ok(None)`, not an error). No messages are ever read back
/// from a search folder through this API today, so no message can be emitted
/// twice — de-duplication would guard against a code path that cannot
/// currently execute. If a future `outlook-pst` upgrade adds real
/// `SearchContentsTable` support to `contents_table()`, this analysis must be
/// redone and de-duplication (preferring the real IPM `folder_path` over the
/// search folder's) added at that point.
