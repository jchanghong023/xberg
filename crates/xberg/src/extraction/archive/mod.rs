//! Archive extraction functionality.
//!
//! This module provides functions for extracting file lists and contents from archives.
//! Supported formats:
//! - ZIP archives
//! - TAR archives (including compressed TAR.GZ, TAR.BZ2)
//! - 7Z archives
//! - GZIP archives
//!
//! Each format has its own submodule with specialized extraction logic.
