//! Rust-only engine extension seams.
//!
//! Cache and progress are injectable through [`EngineBuilder`](super::EngineBuilder).
//! The remaining traits expose standalone Rust primitives for structured extraction,
//! preset lookup, LLM calls, and model resolution; they are not Engine configuration.
//!
//! These are deliberately **not** part of the language-binding surface: the
//! whole `engine` module is a bare `pub mod engine;` in `lib.rs` whose files are
//! not listed in `alef.toml` `sources`, so the binding generator emits nothing
//! for them. The trait names and public seam types are also listed in
//! `alef.toml` `[crates.exclude] types` as belt-and-suspenders.
