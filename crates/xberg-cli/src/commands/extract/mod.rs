//! Extract command - Extract text and data from documents
//!
//! This module provides the extract and batch extract commands for processing single
//! or multiple documents with customizable extraction configurations.
//!
//! The implementation is split by responsibility across submodules:
//! - `timing` - optional per-stage cold-start timing for `--format json`
//! - `images` - writing extracted images to disk
//! - `manifest` - batch input manifest parsing and per-file config resolution
//! - `runtime` - tokio runtime sizing and construction for extraction work
//! - `batch` - the batch extraction command and its result aggregation
