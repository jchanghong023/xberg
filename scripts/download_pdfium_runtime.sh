# 7678, because that is the binding set compiled into the crate, not because it is newest
# (bblanchon publishes far higher). The constraint is the BINDINGS, not the binary:
# `crates/xberg-pdfium-render/src/lib.rs` hardcodes `include!("bindgen/pdfium_7678.rs")` and
# `src/bindgen/` holds exactly that one file, so 7678 IS the compiled ABI contract. A binary whose
# exported symbols do not match it fails at run time, which is exactly how the vendored fork rotted
# (symbols were hand-added and hand-removed to chase drift).
#
# This default read 7881 from 2026-08-21 until GH#1882. Nothing in the tree ever had 7881 bindings,
# so every published image and released musl CLI staged a runtime one release ahead of the bindings
# it was loaded against. It survived because "verified" meant the download succeeded -- the exact
# thing the next sentence forbids.
#
# Bump it only together with a regenerated binding set at the same version, and verify by loading
# the library and resolving symbols -- never by the download alone, which succeeds regardless.
# `DynamicPdfiumBindings::new` probes all 446 required symbols, so a missing one fails cleanly; a
# symbol that is still present but whose signature or struct layout changed is NOT detected
# (`build.rs` sets `layout_tests(false)`), and that is the case worth fearing. ~keep
