# Loads a built musl xberg_nif shared library directly (bypassing
# RustlerPrecompiled's release-download / force_build paths -- see
# scripts/ci/smoke_test_elixir_nif.exs for why) inside a genuine Alpine (musl
# libc) container, and runs a real extraction against a known fixture,
# asserting the exact expected text comes back. Same rationale as
# xberg-io/xberg#490 for the Python wheel: a file-exists check on the .so
# proves nothing about whether it actually loads and runs.
#
# Deliberately does NOT run on the GitHub Actions host directly: the host is
# glibc (ubuntu-latest / ubuntu-24.04-arm), and the entire point of the gate
# is proving the library works on the musl libc family it was cross-compiled
# for.
