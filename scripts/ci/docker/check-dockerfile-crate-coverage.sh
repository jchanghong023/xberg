# Fails fast (no docker build required) when a Cargo workspace member under
# crates/ is neither COPYd into a docker/Dockerfile.* build stage nor
# explicitly stripped from that Dockerfile's copy of Cargo.toml via the
# `sed -i '/<crate>/d; ...' Cargo.toml` exclusion line.
#
# Regression guard for #325: `crates/ttf-parser-compat` was added as a
# workspace member but never added to any Dockerfile's COPY list, so cargo
# failed to load its manifest inside the Docker build context (which only
# contains the crates each Dockerfile explicitly COPYs) while every
# non-Docker CI leg — which checks out the full repo — stayed green.
#
# It also checks a THIRD dimension, whose absence is why this script reported
# "full coverage" on 2026-08-21 while every Docker publish job was failing:
# a COPY can name a real workspace member and still fail, because
# `.dockerignore` starts with `*` and re-includes a hand-written allowlist. A
# path missing from that allowlist is simply not in the build context, and
# buildx dies with `"/crates/<name>": not found`. Being COPYd and being
# reachable are different properties; this script used to check only the first.
#
# It also checks the REVERSE direction, which the member-driven pass above is
# structurally incapable of seeing: a COPY line naming a crate that no longer
# exists. That happened to this very crate — `crates/ttf-parser-compat` was
# deleted when the PDF engine became a path dependency and all ten COPY lines were
# left behind, so every Docker publish job died on
#   "/crates/ttf-parser-compat": not found
# before compiling anything, while this script reported full coverage. Iterating
# over members alone can never catch a dangling COPY; you have to iterate over
# the COPY lines too.
