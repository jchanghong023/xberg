# is self-contained and does not depend on Homebrew install paths at runtime.
#
# This is the macOS analog of vendor-native-closure.sh (which uses ldd / patchelf /
# $ORIGIN on Linux); here we use otool / install_name_tool / codesign. The CLI
# release build links libheif dynamically (the `heic` feature), and without this
# the prebuilt binary carries an absolute Homebrew load command
# (/usr/local/opt/libheif/lib/libheif.1.dylib or /opt/homebrew/...) that is absent
# on users' machines. See xberg-io/xberg#1357.
#
# Homebrew records inter-library dependencies as absolute `opt` paths (not @rpath),
# so walking the absolute-path closure captures everything; the final check fails
# the build if any /opt or /usr/local load path survives.
