"""Guard against a config field that is silently absent from every generated binding.

GH#1745. `task alef:verify` (`alef verify --exit-code`) is a freshness check: it
recomputes each generated file's expected hash from a hash of its own generation
inputs and compares that to what is committed. It is green whenever a fresh
regeneration WOULD reproduce the committed tree -- and it is equally green when a
field was simply never wired into the generator's field list in the first place,
because in that case a regen changes nothing and no hash moves. A field added to
`ExtractionConfig`, `ConcurrencyConfig` or `OcrConfig` that every binding builds via
`..Default::default()` / keyword defaults can therefore ship on Python, Node, PHP,
WASM and the C FFI header with no way to set it, and the freshness gate never
notices. Found while regenerating bindings for #1727; reproduced against a prior
2026-09-12 measurement where the same gate returned success with five binding
manifests reverted.

This is the cheaper of the two fixes GH#1745 proposes. Rather than running a full
`alef all --clean` regeneration in CI (minutes, and it needs sibling polyrepo
checkouts -- see the `alef-bindings-freshness` job in .github/workflows/ci-lint.yaml),
it asserts a purely structural property: every public, non-skipped field of the
config structs in TRACKED_STRUCTS appears BY NAME, in some casing convention,
somewhere inside each language's own generated binding surface.

Known limitation: this proves textual presence, not correct wiring -- a field could
be present as a doc-comment mention, or a short generic field name (e.g. "enabled")
could already appear in the surface for an unrelated reason, in which case the check
would not catch that specific field missing for that specific language. It is
deliberately the coarse, cheap check the issue names as an alternative to a full
regen-and-diff; it exists to catch the exact defect class described above, not to
replace `task alef:verify` or a full regeneration.

Fields marked `#[serde(skip)]` (e.g. `ExtractionConfig::cancel_token`,
`ExtractionConfig::source_name`, `OcrConfig::tessdata_bytes`) never reach the wire
format at all and are excluded from the required set, as are `#[cfg(...)]`-gated
fields (e.g. `ExtractionConfig::tree_sitter`), whose presence in a given binding
depends on which features that binding's generation build enabled -- a question this
static, per-struct check has no way to answer per language.

Exit codes: 0 = every field found in every language's surface, 1 = at least one
field is missing from at least one language, 2 = malformed input (struct not found,
unbalanced braces, or a language surface path does not exist).
