# Assert the Windows Ruby gem's two feature switches agree.
#
# The Windows leg builds xberg-rb with an explicit `--features` list while the Windows target
# dependency asks the core for the `windows-gnu-target` bundle. Those are separate switches:
# the binding's own features decide which `#[cfg(feature = "...")]`-gated match arms, struct
# fields and registrations alef emits, while the bundle decides which variants and fields the
# core actually has. When a core feature is enabled by the bundle and its same-named binding
# feature is NOT selected, the core keeps the variant and the binding loses the arm, and the
# generated conversions stop compiling. That has now broken the release twice -- 827 E0004
# errors once, 453 errors the next time -- and neither was visible on the Linux or macOS legs.
#
# Cargo features are additive, so this cannot be fixed by narrowing one side; the two lists
# have to be kept in step, and this is what makes "in step" checkable instead of assumed.
